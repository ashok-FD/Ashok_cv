            <b>In</b> the context of human society, a family is a group of people related either by consanguinity (by recognized birth), affinity (by marriage or other relationship), or co-residence  or some combination of these.
            Members of the immediate family may include spouses, parents, brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters.
            Members of the extended family may include grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, and siblings-in-law.
            these are also considered members of the immediate family, depending on an individual's specific relationship with them

            I love the excitement</b> of it all — feeling like an explorer — discovering a new land, a new language, new money and all the little challenges that go along with it. When I travel, I am more spontaneous and don’t live for the future or the past… just in the moment. Being impulsive and saying ‘yes’ to nearly everything is part of the fun.
            I love the rush. Habitual runners get off on the kick-in of endorphins that give them that extra boost they need to keep going. I get the same jolt from a day of travel or an unexpected side trip to a new and undiscovered land (for me… not for all mankind) that I hadn’t planned to visit.  Traveling seems to give me a near constant adrenaline rush.  After a few years of uninterrupted travel, I became quite addicted to this feeling. Traveling can be a challenge, but to me, a fun challenge that I enjoy conquering time and time again.
            Plus it sure beats having to vacuum, pay bills, or shop for toilet paper.

          <p><b>
            A </b>village is a part of a world clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand.
            Though villages are often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighborhoods.
            Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur.
            Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.
            This also enabled specialization of labor and crafts, and development of many trades.
            The trend of urbanization continues, though not always in connection with industrialization.
            Although many patterns of village life have existed, the typical village is often small, consisting of perhaps 5 to 30 families.
            Historically homes were situated together for sociability and defence, and land surrounding the living quarters was farmed.
            Traditional fishing villages were based on artisan fishing and located adjacent to fishing grounds.
